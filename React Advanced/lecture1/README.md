Here we are going to create our custom hook

1. axios
Axios is a promise-based HTTP library that lets developers make requests to either their own server or a third-party server to fetch data. It offers different ways of making requests such as GET , POST , PUT/PATCH , and DELETE .

2. await
await is a keyword in JavaScript used in conjunction with async functions. It allows you to pause the execution of an async function until a Promise is resolved or rejected. When you use await, it effectively "waits" for the Promise to settle, and then returns the result. If the Promise is rejected, await throws the error.

3. async function
An async function in JavaScript is a function that operates asynchronously via the event loop, using an implicit Promise to return its result. An async function can contain one or more await expressions, which pause the execution of the function, waiting for the Promise to resolve.
