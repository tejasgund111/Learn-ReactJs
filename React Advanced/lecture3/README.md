These is the app in continuation with the app which we have created in lecture 2 

we are going to add some more functionality in the app in this session by adding some additional pages like 
1. Blog page -> its path -> baseUrl/blog/blogId
2. Category page -> its path -> baseUrl/categories/categoryName
3. Tag page -> its path -> baseUrl/tags/tagName
4. Home page

// if we want to access any search parameter or want to change any parameter we will use 'useSearchParams' hook and 'useLocation' hook

// we have not styled it
